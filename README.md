# Modular OpenCV implementation to learn some Python
This repo is just a test repo to learn how to modularize my code better. I'll be going over basic most of the basic functionalities in OpenCV and attempt to imlpement them as modules. So, it's not really a useful repo.

# Additional details will be added later as per requirement
We need to test out tagging later don't forget about that
